## Ingredients

* Brisket
* Marinade:
    * 1 part worcestershire sauce
    * 1 part soy sauce
    * 1 part bourbon
    * Couple tablespoons of minced garlic
    * Couple tablespoons of mustard
    * Ground black pepper
    * Slightly more chilli flakes than I intended
    * Couple bay leafs

## Equipment required

* Marinading vessel
* Cooking dish
* Oven

## Method

1. Mix all marinade ingredients
2. Coat brisket in marinade and leave in fridge overnight
    * Ensure meat is covered by marinade - Pro tip: Putting into a large sandwich bag and squeezing out the air will leave more bourbon for drinking
    * "Overnight" should preferably last from early evening (around 2am) until early morning (2pm)
3. Put in oven and cook at low temperature until done
4. Rest for a bit while enjoying a small glass of bourbon
5. Slice or shred meat, ensuring you eat at least 1/3 of it while doing so
6. Later, while watching [Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3339966/) and writing [this recipie](.), throw the word "brisket" into [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) to dobule check the spelling, then forget why you did that and click through to [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisket) and see [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BeefCutBrisket.svg) and [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:British_Beef_Cuts.svg) brisket cuts are quite different, and be like "whatttt???"
7. Have some more bourbon
